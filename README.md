# New-York-City-Taxicab-Analysis

This project analyzes New York City taxicab trip data to uncover trends, insights, and patterns related to ride distances, fare amounts, and pickup/dropoff locations. The analysis leverages various data science techniques, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning models.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to explore and model New York City taxi trip data. The analysis includes:
- **Data cleaning and preprocessing** to handle missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand ride patterns across different locations, times, and days of the week.
- **Feature Engineering** to create new variables such as weekend indicators, public holiday markers, and more.
- **Machine Learning Models** for predicting fare amounts and analyzing factors that impact taxi rides.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes New York City yellow taxi trip records. It contains information about:
- **Pickup and Dropoff locations** (latitude/longitude and zone IDs)
- **Trip distances** (in miles)
- **Fare amounts** (total fare for each trip)
- **Passenger count** and other related variables.
